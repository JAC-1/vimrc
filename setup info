bracey requires nodejs to be installed, along with npm for the initial installation of dependencies. Although, in most cases, npm will probably be installed along with nodejs.

bracey does not include it's javascript dependencies in the repository and they must be downloaded separately. after the plugin has been installed, you need to install its dependencies.

    change into the plugins installation directory. This is different for every plugin manager but should be something like
        cd ~/.vim/bundle/bracey.vim for pathogen/neoBundle/vundle
        cd ~/.vim/plugged/bracey.vim for plug
    run npm install --prefix server
        you can automate this for vim-plug by using the following command in your .vimrc: Plug 'turbio/bracey.vim', {'do': 'npm install --prefix server'}. This will run the npm command every time you update the plugin as well
